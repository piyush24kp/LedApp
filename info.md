# UniLED - The Universal Light Controller

### UniLED supports the following range of BLE LED controllers:

### üì±LED Chord
  - **SP107E** - SPI RGB(W) Controller

### üì±LED Hue
  - **SP110E** - SPI RGB(W) Controller

### üì±BanlanX
  - **SP601E** / **SP602E** / **SP608E** - Multi Channel SPI RGB Controllers
  - **SP611E** - SPI RGB Controller
  - **SP613E** - PWM RGB Controller
  - **SP614E** - PWM RGBW Controller
  - **SP6117** - SPI RGBW Controller
  - **SP620E** - USB SPI RGB Mini Controller
  - **SP621E** - Mini SPI RGB Controller
  - **SP623E** - Mini PWM RGB Controller
  - **SP624E** - Mini PWM RGBW Controller
  - **SP630E** - PWM/SPI RGB, RGBW, RGBCCT Controller
  - **SP631E** / **SP641E** - PWM Single Color Controllers
  - **SP632E** / **SP642E** - PWM CCT Controllers
  - **SP633E** / **SP643E** - PWM RGB Controllers
  - **SP634E** / **SP644E** - PWM RGBW Controllers
  - **SP635E** / **SP645E** - PWM RGBCCT Controllers
  - **SP636E** / **SP646E** - SPI Single Color Controllers
  - **SP637E** / **SP647E** - SPI CCT Controllers
  - **SP638E** / **SP648E** - SPI RGB Controllers
  - **SP639E** / **SP649E** - SPI RGBW Controllers
  - **SP63AE** / **SP64AE** - SPI RGBCCT Controllers

#### üí°Hints and Tips
1. For those devices that support "Effect Length", set the length to the number of LEDS.
   
#### üßê Notes:
1. These devices only support a single bluetooth connection at any one time. If you connect via the app, then HA will not be able to connect and visa versa, when HA is connected and controlling the device, you will not be able to connect to it via the app.
2. For those devices that support custom effects, such as the SP630E, UniLED only supports selecting the custom effect, you will have to disable the device in HA and use the android or IOS app to configure it first, then renable in HA.
3. HA will report certain entities, such as Effect Speed as being unavailable when the chosen effect does not support it, for example when using a solid effect, the effect speed will show as unavailable until a dynamic effect is selected. 

### üì±Hao Deng
#### **Basic** support for Hao Deng/Zengge BLE Mesh devices.

## üöÄ Installation

### HACS Automated Installation

You can install this component through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) to easily receive updates.

After installing HACS, visit the HACS _Integrations_ pane and add `https://github.com/monty68/uniled` as an `Integration` by following [these instructions](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/). You'll then be able to install it through the _Integrations_ pane.

### Manual Installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `uniled`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/uniled/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the HA UI go to "Settings" -> "Devices & Services" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Universal Light Controller"

### ‚úçÔ∏è Adding Devices and Model Identification Issues

UniLED does it's best to identify the exact model through a number of different mechanisms, however
if you are having difficulty adding a device, especially where it fails to identify the model. Then,
first try using the applicable Android/IOS app and ensure the device name is set to match the devices
model then attempt adding the device into Home Assistant. If it still fails, enable debugging (see below) in Home Assistant, re-attempt adding the device, then open an issue attaching the debug log 
output to assist with further invetigation.

## ü™≤ Debugging

To debug the integration, add the following to your `configuration.yaml`

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.uniled: debug
```

## üôã Contributions are always welcomed!
